# Changelog

## Version 0.0.2
### ‚öôÔ∏è Patches
- **Code cleanup**
  - Combined `AddRepo` & `FetchRepoIndex` into a single method.
  - Decoupled `Login` & `AddRepo` methods to allow for proper authentication. OCI uses `login + OCI pull`, while legacy uses `AddRepo + legacy pull`.
  - Made the code more modular by creating helper functions for common tasks.
  - seperated helm functions into separate files for readability.
  - removed `ioutil` package because [deprecated & redundant](https://go.dev/doc/go1.16#ioutil), incorporated into and since maintained in `io` & `os`.
